550 Madison Avenue is a postmodern skyscraper on Madison Avenue
between 55th Street and 56th Street in New York City. Designed by
Philip Johnson and John Burgee with associate architect Simmons
Architects, the building was completed in 1984. It is a 647-foot-tall
(197-meter), 37-story office tower with a facade made of pink
granite. It was originally the headquarters of AT&T Corp., which
relocated from 195 Broadway, the company's previous
headquarters. Following the breakup of the Bell System in 1982, AT&T
spun off subsidiary corporations and never occupied the entire
building as it had originally intended. The building later became the
American headquarters of Sony. An annex to the west was demolished and
replaced in the early 2020s. Opinion of the building has been mixed
ever since its design was first announced in March 1978. The New York
City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the building's
exterior as a landmark in 2018.
