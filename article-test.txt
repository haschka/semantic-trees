Abstract
Background: SARS-CoV-2 is a rapidly spreading disease affecting human life and the economy on a global scale.
The disease has caused so far more then 5.5 million deaths. The omicron outbreak that emerged in Botswana in the
south of Africa spread around the globe at further increased rates, and caused unprecedented SARS-CoV-2 infection
incidences in several countries. At the start of December 2021 the first omicron cases were reported in France.
Methods: In this paper we investigate the spreading potential of this novel variant relatively to the delta variant that
was also in circulation in France at that time. Using a dynamic multi-variant model accounting for cross-immunity
through a status-based approach, we analyze screening data reported by Santé Publique France over 13 metropolitan
French regions between 1st of December 2021 and the 30th of January 2022. During the investigated period, the
delta variant was replaced by omicron in all metropolitan regions in approximately three weeks. The analysis conducted retrospectively allows us to consider the whole replacement time window and compare regions with different
times of omicron introduction and baseline levels of variants’ transmission potential. As large uncertainties regarding
cross-immunity among variants persist, uncertainty analyses were carried out to assess its impact on our estimations.
Results: Assuming that 80% of the population was immunized against delta, a cross delta/omicron cross-immunity
of 25% and an omicron generation time of 3.5 days, the relative strength of omicron to delta, expressed as the ratio of
their respective reproduction rates, R̂omicron , was found to range between 1.51 and 1.86 across regions. Uncertainty
R̂delta

analysis on epidemiological parameters led to R̂omicron ranging from 1.57 to 2.34 on average over the metropolitan
R̂delta

French regions, weighted by population size.
Conclusions: Upon introduction, omicron spread rapidly through the French territory and showed a high fitness
relative to delta. We documented considerable geographical heterogeneities on the spreading dynamics. The historical reconstruction of variant emergence dynamics provide valuable ground knowledge to face future variant emergence events.

SARS-CoV2 mutations have been classified into different
variants that have caused further isolated or overlapping
epidemic waves in many countries [1]. In particular, variants with increased transmissibility, increased severity or
immune escape were observed, and defined to be variants of concern (VOC). These VOCs were further named
after the letters of the Greek alphabet.
The omicron SARS-CoV-2 VOC, first detected in
Botswana in the south of Africa [2] in November 2021,
spread rapidly around the world [3, 4]. The mutations
observed on this variant are expressing a different form
of the Spike protein [5], seemingly causing immune
escape [6] and higher infection rates [7–10].
The detection of the omicron variant in France was
noticed at the start of December 2021 [11]. Early assessments of its dynamics pointed to a rapid growth and
hence, a substantial spreading advantage over the delta
variant, the circulating variant at that time in France [12,
13]. Therefore, omicron has been attributed the potential to cause a large-scale epidemic wave [12–14]. The
rate of daily detected cases, indeed, underwent unprecedented growth and over 300,000 detected cases per day
were registered in the first half of January for this country
consisting of a population of almost 67 million inhabitants [15]. Here, we retrospectively analysed the dynamics
of the emergence of the omicron variant and the replacement of the delta variant across all French regions.All the
data that we have at our disposal from Sante Publique
France, which is further detailed in section 2.1, highlights
only a negligible proportion of observed omicron samples at the beginning of December, and an almost 100%
occurrence of omicron samples at the end of January for
all French metropolitan regions. Therefore, we focused
our study on a time-frame between December 2021 and
January 2022. According to https://​outbr​eak.​info [16–18]
and [19, 20] lineages besides BA.2 did not yet emerge in
significant rates during that period. Lineage BA.2 itself
did not account for more then 10% of samples by the end
of January 2022 and we focused therefore on an omicron
invasion on French territory that is BA.1 based.
In order to perform this study we developed a statusbased multi-variant compartmental model which was
built upon [21]. This model allows us to simulate the
coevolution of multiple variants independently and link
them with an interaction matrix, accounting for cross
immunity between the different variants. Hence, the
model is perfectly adapted for the situation where one
variant is replaced by another. Fitting this model to the
data observed in France during the winter of 2021/2022
allows us to quantify the relative advantage of the omicron variant over the delta variant and its spatial heterogeneity on the replacement dynamics, by accounting for

uncertainty in different factors, such as the generation
time of a specific variant.

Methods
Data acquisition and preprocessing

PCR-confirmed cases associated with SARS-CoV-2
mutations were obtained from Santé Publique France1
for the 13 metropolitan French regions. The data includes
the number of tests that underwent the screening for a
selection of mutations in their amino acid sequence. Different mutations were monitored for their impact on
viral functioning and because they were recognised as
indicators of different VOCs. In particular, the E484K
mutation is commonly used as an indicator of a beta or
gamma variant and the L452R as an indicator of the delta
variant. The absence of these two mutations is characteristic of the alpha, omicron or other lineages, e.g. B.1.640.
Periodic whole genome sequencing surveys showed that
B.1.640 was circulating at a low level in France at the time
of omicron introduction to be rapidly replaced by omicron around mid December [12, 13]. The omicron lineage
BA.5 could exert the L452R mutation but were according to [16–18] not, or only in negligible quantities [19,
20], present in metropolitan France in the investigated
period. In late November 2021, a dedicated surveillance
protocol was established in France targeting a set of
mutations specific to the omicron variant. The initial set
of mutations was soon updated to become in late December: deletion of site 69/70 and/or substitutions K417N
and/or S371L-S373P and/or Q493R [22]. The protocol
was initially adopted by certain laboratories to become
progressively more widespread throughout December,
early January.
Available records were used to describe the co-circulation of omicron, delta and beta/gamma. Records
with L452R mutation were interpreted as delta variant. E484K mutations were taken as indicator of beta/
gamma variant. These were counted in negligible fractions but were kept for completeness. For omicron the
two alternative options for data interpretations were subject to different potential biases. The use of the absence
of L452R and E484K mutations as a proxy for omicron
was biased around the onset of omicron invasion due
to the co-circulation with other lineages. Given that
omicron became dominant among the samples without
L452R mutation at the very beginning of its invasion, as
explained above, this biases had likely a limited effect on
the whole replacement curve. On the other hand, the use
of the omicron-specific set of mutations was likely biased

from Santé Publique France for the Ile-de-France region with the 20 day window of opportunity around the inflection point as it has been chosen for
this modelling study

during the period from the end of November and beginning of January when such an indicator was adjusted and
gradually adopted throughout the French territory. Given
our interest on the entire replacement period between
the beginning of December and the end of January, we
assumed in the baseline analysis omicron to be described
by the absence of L452R and E484K mutations. Still, we
considered the alternative indicator in the sensitivity
analysis.
Visual inspection of the time series between 1st
December 2021 and 31th January 2022 reveals that the
invasion of omicron, more precisely the lineage BA.1,
occurs approximately in three weeks in all the regions of
metropolitan France. As such we defined for each region
a window of opportunity of 20 days for the analysis. The
onset of this window is defined by its midpoint, the 10th

day, where omicron shall supplant the delta variant in
absolute numbers, meaning that the omicron variant
exceeds 50% of reported samples at this midpoint. This
approach is outlined in Fig. 1 which represents the data
of a typical French region and its selected 20 day window of opportunity (Fig. 1C). The dataset provided by
Santé Publique France is smoothed over a 7-day sliding
window.
Multi‑variant transmission model

We modelled the co-circulation of three variants. Inspired
by [21], we proposed a status-based multi-variant compartmental model allowing us to evaluate the delta, omicron
and residual beta/gamma variants simultaneously, which
interact with each other using a cross-immunity term. A
schematic overview of the model is shown in Fig. 1A. As

Haschka et al. BMC Infectious Diseases

outlined in this figure the main advantage of this model
is that allows us to simulate multiple variants simultaneously taking the immunity acquired, due to the infection
by one variant against an other variant into account. This
property is modeled using a cross-immunity matrix ǫik .
The authors of [21] have proposed a similar parsimonious
process to model a large number of competing strains, with
application to the influenza dynamics. We largely adapted
this model in our study for the purpose of describing the
dynamics of competing SARS-CoV-2 variants. The model
is defined by the ordinary differential eqs. (1–4), where
state variables stand for proportions of different compartments in the population from the viewpoint of each variant
i:

dSi = ηi Ri − Si
ǫik βk Ik dt,

k=1

dEi = (βi Si Ii − δi Ei )dt,

(2)

dIi = (δi Ei − γi Ii )dt,

(3)

Ri = 1 − Si − Ei − Ii .

(4)

Si represents the population susceptible, Ei the incubating non infectious population and Ii the population
of infectious individuals. Compartment Ri models an
immunized population that either underwent infection
and recovered from the disease or has been vaccinated. βi
represents the transmission rate, ηi is the immunity waning rate, δi the rate at which exposed individuals become
infectious, or the inverse of the mean sojourn time in E
compartment, and γi the recovery rate or the inverse of
the infectiousness duration. Variant interaction is modelled by a cross-immunity matrix, where element ǫik
describes the acquired protection to an acquisition of
variant i conferred by an infection with variant k. For a
given reproduction rate at time t, R̂k (t), the transmission
rate βk can be obtained from:
βk =

R̂k (t = 0)γk
,
1 − ak

(5)

where ak represents the immunization level in the population against variant k at the beginning of the study
period. In further detail, in eq. (1) the Si nk=1 ǫik βk Ik
term models the cross-immunity and, at the same time,
the exit from the susceptible compartment of newly
infected individuals. It is therefore the most significant
part of this model. Aforementioned βk as outlined in eq.
(1), modulates the strength of the infection, while the ǫik
matrix makes sure that variants i are also affected by a
pull resulting from infected individuals Ik , and takes, as

such, care about the cross-immunity. Further equations
of the model (2,3,4) follow standard SEIR modelling
procedures, with the main difference being that index i
accounts for multiple variants in coevolution. In the case
of the omicron variant, the immunized fraction aomicron
is obtained by multiplying the fraction of population
immune against the delta variant adelta with the crossimmunity between omicron and delta:

aomicron = adelta ǫ[delta,omicron] .

(6)

We assume that R̂k (t) is constant over the investigated
period, and we define the relative epidemic fitness of variant i to the delta variant as the ratio of reproduction
rates: R̂i .
R̂delta

Parameter values were either (i) based on literature
values in the case of δi and γi , or (ii) hypothesised for
ak , ηi and ǫik , with different values tested for robustness
purposes for both (i) and (ii) (see Sect. 2.4), or (iii) estimated from data for βi [related to R̂k , equation (5)]. In
the baseline scenario, the mean generation time, which
is expressed in our model for a variant i as 1/δi + 1/γi ,
was assumed equal to 5 days for delta, 3.5 days for omicron [23] and 8 days for the other variants (beta/gamma)
[24, 25]. The corresponding durations (1/δi and 1/γi ) in Ei
and Ii compartments were assumed equal to (2,3) days,
(1.4, 2.1) days and (5,3) days for delta, omicron and beta/
gamma variants, respectively. A further in detail overview of all rate constants evaluated is outlined in Table 1.
The model is integrated using a Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg
(RKF) algorithm with variable step size [26]. Further we
interpolate a third order polynomial on subsequent successions of four obtained data points. This allows us to
extract a value on the continuum between the start and

the end of the simulation performed with the model
described herein. The source code for the model, written
in C, has been made available on Github2.
Fitting the model to the data and initial conditions

The model was fitted to the reported proportions of sampled variants for each French metropolitan region independently. The fit was performed on a 20 days window
starting 10 days prior the inflection point where the omicron variant is present in more than half of the samples.
For all metropolitan French regions, initial conditions
were obtained by collecting public estimates of SARSCoV-2 incidence and reproduction rates, for all variants
combined, for the 6th, 13th and 20th of December from
Santé Publique France3. More precisely, the initial conditions were computed based on this data as follows: for
each region, t = 0 represents the first day of the 20-day
study period in our simulations. Depending on the date
of the initial point of the study period, we define q(t = 0)
and R̂delta (t = 0) to be the linear interpolations of these
collected estimates for each region. If the first day of the
20 days of the simulated window happens before the 6th
of December or after the 20th of December, no interpolation is performed and the values from the respective day
are taken. Visual inspection confirms that 10 days prior
the inflection point, at the beginning of our window of
opportunity, omicron cases were still very rare. As such,
the interpolated reproduction rate R̂ was entirely attributed to the delta variant and stayed constant through the
study period.
For each region-associated time window, we used the
obtained initial incidence rate q(t = 0) to set the initial
conditions of compartments Ei (t = 0) and Ii (t = 0) as
follows:

i = 1(delta) : 1δ q(t = 0) nPi (t=0)
i=1 Pi (t=0) ,

G = {R̂i , ui : i � = 1(variants other than delta) }. Parameters minimizing the loss function L (6) were estimated.
Mean estimates as well as standard variations across
regions for the omicron reproduction ratio were calculated. We also computed estimates weighted according to

As outlined in Fig. 1B, independent fits were performed
in conjunction with parameter sweeps to overcome
uncertainties as further detailed in Sect. 2.4.
Sensitivity analysis

As uncertainty still exists regarding some model parameters such as the generation time and few information is
available on others such as variant-specific immunity in
the population, we performed a sensitivity/uncertainty
analysis to investigate the impact of the different model
parameters on our estimates and subsequent variant
dynamics.
More precisely, we varied: (i) the generation time of the
omicron variant setting it to equal to 3, 3.5, 4 and 6 days
as shown in Table 1 which summarizes tested values, (ii)
the acquired immunity in the population a against variants prior to omicron obtained either by infection or
vaccination, with a ∈ (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8), and (iii) the crossimmunity ǫ that this immunity confers to the omicron
variant, with ǫ ∈ (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0).
First, the impact of varying model parameters in terms
of model fitting was explored for all parameters (i)–(iii).
Second, the impact of the uncertainty in model parameters on replacement dynamics was investigated. When
a new variant replaces the established variant, we can

Haschka et al. BMC Infectious Diseases

numerically quantify the relative fitness by means of t ,
i.e. the time it takes for a new variant to rise from 10% to
50% of positively tested cases in a population. This idea
is illustrated in Fig. 4A, for both a less fitter new variant
(orange) characterised by t1 and a stronger new variant
(blue) characterised by t2, respectively. To get a better
understanding of the relationship between our fitness
estimates and parameters a (ii) and ǫ (iii), we analysed in
the model variations of:

�t10%−50% (R̂new , ǫ, a),

(9)

as a function of the reproduction rate R̂new of the new
variant, the cross-immunity between invading and
established variant ǫ and the immunity a against the
established variant. For these simulations, we fixed the
reproduction rate R̂established of the established variant
to 1.1. and evaluated our model on a grid varying R̂new ,
ǫ and a to evaluate resulting t . R̂new was varied between
1.2 and 2.2 in 31 increments of 0.34, whereas ǫ and a were
given each four different values as detailed above, yielding a total of 512 simulation scenarios.

Results
Regional fits and relative fitness of omicron against delta
in metropolitan France

For metropolitan France in its entirety we find that the
relative fitness of the omicron variant over the delta variant R̂omicron is equal to 1.72. This value was obtained by
R̂delta

assuming that 80% of the population was immunized
against delta either by natural infection or vaccination
and hence set a = 0.8. Further we estimated that one
fourth of this delta-immune population procured a partial immunity against omicron and thus set
ǫ[delta,omicron] = 0.25. Finally generation times of 5 days
for the delta and 3.5 days for omicron variant where
assumed respectively.
For this specific scenario, region specific assumed values for R̂delta ans estimated values for R̂omicron are displayed in Additional file 1: Table S1, and replacement
curves and associated fits for all regions are reported in
Fig. 2. The general trend is globally well reproduced by
the model in all regions. The lowest fitness estimate was

obtained for Corsica, with R̂omicron = 1.51, while the highR̂delta

est for Nouvelle-Aquitaine, with R̂omicron = 1.86. DistribuR̂delta

tion of fitness values is summarised in Fig. 3. The different
regions assessed by this study feature variations in population density. Especially the Île-de-France region stands
out with a population density larger than 1000 inhabitants per square kilometer. We investigated this matter as
shown in Additional file 1: Fig. S9 in the supporting
information and did not find any correlation between
population density of a region and the relative transmission rates obtained for it.
Sensitivity to uncertain model parameters

As a result of the robustness analysis on fitting, when the
generation time of omicron is sampled at 3, 3.5, 4 and 6
days, we can remark that the relative strength of the omicron variant increases as the generation time approaches
the generation time of the delta variant. The resulting
shift in relative fitness can be observed in comparing
Fig. 3 and Additional file 1: Fig. S1 to S3 or S4 to S7 if the
data is interpreted with the alternative definition of omicron, found in the supporting information.
During our parameter sweep, the minimal relative fitness R̂omicron of 1.38 is observed for Corsica as the generaR̂delta

tion time for omicron is set to 3 days. The
Nouvelle-Aquitaine region exhibits the maximum value
of 1.99 as the generation time for omicron is 4 days.
Assuming a generation time of 5 days for delta and 3 days
for the omicron variant we find that the average relative
fitness R̂omicron , weighted by regional population size,
R̂delta

ranged from 1.58 to 1.61. Increasing the generation time
of omicron from 3 to 6, the relative fitness is increased to
2.31–2.34 in average. Estimates according to generation
time assumptions are detailed in Table 2.
Estimates of omicron relative fitness do not seem to
depend on the assumptions on cross-immunity conferred
by previous immunity to delta in preventing omicron
acquisition (Table 2 and Fig. 3). Varying the preimmunization levels of the population at the onset of the omicron
invasion does not affect relative fitness values obtained
from our model either. When varying these parameters,

Discussion
In this article we present a mechanistic model to simulate a multivariant epidemic of SARS-CoV-2. The model
was used to analyse SARS-CoV-2 variant data reported
by Santé Publique France between 1st of December 2021
and 30th of January 2022 on the proportions of different mutations occurring in a specially sampled subset of
PCR tests at the French regional level. We detail how this
model can be applied in order to evaluate the fitness of an
emerging variant, relatively to established SARS-CoV-2
variants. Knowing the relative fitness of a new emerging
variant against a previously observed variant, and having
a model at hand to describe the dynamics of all variants
is important for decision-makers in order to evaluate the
risks caused by the epidemic and carefully plan future
stress exhorted on public health systems, the economy
and other affected areas.
Using the modeling framework outlined herein, we
quantify the transmissibility advantage of the omicron
variant as outlined in Table 2 and Figs. 2 and 3. The relative fitness between the omicron and delta variant is
expressed by the fraction R̂omicron and was found to range
R̂delta
between 1.51 and 1.86 across regions when assuming that
80% of the population was immunized against delta, a
cross delta_omicron cross-immunity of 25% and an omicron generation time parameterized to 3.5 days.
Figure 3 displays the increased transmissibility of the
omicron variant compared to the delta variant as a distribution across all French regions. Using parameter
sweeps, notably across different delta-omicron crossimmunities and preimmunity levels to the delta variant,
we showed that this result was very robust and is almost
not influenced by different hypotheses about the values
of these two features at the beginning of December. These
results are outlined in Table 2. Across all scenarios, our
weighted average estimates of the increased transmissibility found for the omicron variant compared to the
delta variant ranged from R̂omicron = 1.57 to R̂omicron = 2.34

that these results were obtained based on the absence of
the L452R mutation only to identify omicron. Results for
different variant indicators to describe omicron are highlighted in Additional file 1: Table S2 and Figures S3–S6.

Two studies provided early assessment of omicron
initial spread in France [12, 13]. The study in [13] quantified the doubling time of omicron at the national
level and for the Île de France and Centre-Val de Loire
regions—the only two regions reporting substantial

We see that in the regime of R̂(t = 0)omicron /R̂(t = 0)delta > 1.5, preimmunization and cross-immunity play a minor role in the steepness of variant
replacement. On x-axis labels, “new” ans “established” stand for omicron and delta, respectively

spread in the community at the time of the study—
reporting values ranging between 1.8 and 2.5 days. The
additive advantage in transmission was estimated at
105% by [12] from nationwide data. Our analysis considers the whole period of omicron replacement in all
13 regions in metropolitan France. Results confirm the

rapid spread of omicron and provide estimates compatible with [12]. We highlight a variation in omicron
fitness by region with a 20% deviation between the
minimum and maximum transmission advantage relative to the weighted average across regions.

Haschka et al. BMC Infectious Diseases

(2022) 22:815

Our analysis is also comparable with previous studies
made outside of France. Similar estimates of main
parameters were indeed provided for Great Britain
[23]. The British study finds an implied transmission
advantage of omicron in the range of 160–210%. Prior
studies from South Africa data find values either
slightly above ours R̂omicron [7] ranging from 1.8 to 3.2,
R̂delta

with a mean variation over the month of November
2021 to be between 2.3 and 2.6, or in a second study [8]
below our results with values for R̂omicron lying between
R̂delta

0.75 and 2.0. Interestingly, a study using Danish data [9]
estimated much higher values R̂omicron 3.19 with a 95%
R̂delta

confidence interval ranging from 2.82 to 3.61. Differences in the estimates may depend on different factors,
including the surveillance protocols, the precise definition of the transmission advantage, and the modelling
approach used for the data analysis.
The preimmunization levels of the population as well as
different hypotheses about delta-omicron cross-immunity have almost no effect on the relative fitness estimates
(Table 2 and Additional file 1: Table S2), possibly due also
to identifiablity issues. Our simulations supported this
result, showing that variations in ǫ[delta,omicron] and a are
not expected to yield significant deviations in the dynamics of variant replacement when R̂omicron is high enough
R̂delta

(> 1.5) (Fig. 4).
The relative fitness R̂omicron is however sensitive to
R̂delta

hypotheses regarding differences in generation time
between the delta and omicron variants. We investigated
four values 3, 3.5, 4 and 6 days, for the generation time
duration of the omicron variant, while keeping the delta
variant at a constant generation time of 5 days. Although
estimates distributions across regions were not changed,
a shift towards higher values of R̂omicron was observed as
R̂delta

the generation time for the omicron was variant
increased. Results for comparing different generation
times are outlined in Table 2 and in Fig. 3 as well as in
Additional file 1: Figs. S1-S5 in the supporting information. This result is coherent with a previously published
analysis of omicron invasion in Great Britain [23].
During 2021, prior to the omicron wave, several studies have hypothesized different scenarios for the winter
period 2021/2022. Sah et al. [27] have built several models
to predict the situation in the USA. These authors state
that immune escape has to be coupled with increased
transmission rates for a variant to be successful. Dyson
et al. [28] also explored, through various models, the
dynamics of several hypothetical variants. The authors of
[28] show that immune escape can slowly develop future
waves that might not be easily predictable and can hit the
population at later stages of the pandemic. Compared to

Page 11 of 13

our study, [27, 28] make long term predictions while we
focus on the short period of quick replacement by omicron of the delta variant which lasted, as outlined, only 3
weeks.
As the analyzed data is not derived from whole genome
sequencing but rather from the identification of specific
mutations of the virus genome, the data published by
Santé Publique France that tracks omicron strains
allowed for different interpretations of the dataset. Here,
we adopted the L452R mutation as an indicator for the
delta variant, in presence of the mutation, and the omicron variant, in its absence. An alternative approach consists in combining the mutation L452R taken as a proxy
for the delta variant with the set of omicron-specific
mutations—deletion of site 69/70 and/or substitutions
K417N and/or S371L-S373P and/or Q493R—as an indicator for omicron. The use of the two different indicators
yields two distinct time series for each studied regions.
Using only L452R both as an indicator for delta, in the
presence of the mutation, as well as for omicron, in the
absence of the mutation, yields less fluctuations in the
time series, as outlined by the comparison of Fig. 2 and
Additional file 1: Fig. S6. Using only this single mutation
may in principle overestimate the omicron proportion at
the onset of the omicron invasion, as a small non-delta
fraction was continuously present in the dataset. However, the bias is likely to be limited in that full genome
sequencing data showed that omicron become rapidly
dominant among other variants without the L452R mutation during the first weeks of December [12, 13]. The
time series based on multi-mutation definition were also
analysed and relative fitness values R̂omicron were evaluR̂delta

ated. A larger omicron fitness was estimated as we analysed this second time series. This could be explained by
the progressive mounting of this surveillance protocol
concomitant with the omicron invasion, which may have
biased the observation of the omicron dynamics. The different results for the two representations are outlined in
the Table 2 and Additional file 1: Table S2. However, both
definitions led to estimates that were consistent with
those reported by various studies around the globe [7–9,
23].
No significant correlation between population density
and effective omicron relative fitness as outlined by Additional file 1: Fig. S9 in the supporting information was
observed. Several regional socio-demographic influencing
factors could lead to changes in the spread of the different
variants as outlined for instance in [29]. Focusing here on
the relative fitness between omicron and delta, we did not
pursue these issues further, as we found that population
density appears to be decorrelated from the relative fitness between the two variants, and that the relative fitness
does not seem to vary as strongly as demography.

Conclusion
We estimated that as omicron replaced delta in France during winter 2021/2022, the relative fitness of the omicron
variant compared to the delta variant, R̂omicron , ranges from
R̂delta
1.57 to 2.34. We propose here a multi-variant framework
that enables short-term analysis of the epidemiological
characteristics of an emerging variant using epidemiological data. The model presented here could be easily applied
to other dynamic systems describing the evolution of epidemic diseases evolving into different variants.
